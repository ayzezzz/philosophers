Philosopher is a simulation of the dining philosophers problem, demonstrating synchronization issues and deadlocks in concurrent programming. It simulates multiple philosophers who alternate between eating and thinking, utilizing threads to represent each philosopher's actions. Mutexes are employed to manage access to shared resources (forks) and prevent race conditions, ensuring that only one philosopher can use a fork at a time. This project provides practical insights into multi-threading, resource management, and inter-thread communication in C, highlighting the importance of synchronization in concurrent systems.
